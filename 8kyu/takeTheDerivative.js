/**
 * Take the Derivative
 * This function takes two numbers as parameters, the first number being 
 * the coefficient, and the second number being the exponent. Your function
 * should multiply the two numbers, and then subtract 1 from the exponent.
 * Then, it has to return an expression (like 28x^7). "^1" should not be 
 * truncated when exponent = 2.
